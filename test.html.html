<p title="first pp" style="color:maroon"> This is my first paragraph of html. It is simple to code and set up. I wonder what happens with line wraps? Sadly, I need to write a lot of words to make sure that I get to see. Think that's enough? Maybe... </p>

<p style="font-family:Times" >Let's add a <a href="http://www.desigknit.com">link</a> </p>

<p style="text-align:center"> And an image:
